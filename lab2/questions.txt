1.	Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout.?
We want to use setImmediate when we have to execute the callback if all the events in the I/O are processed so it is faster than setTimeOut.
             
2.	Explain difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

Process.nextTick is not part of event loop, nextTickQueue will be processed after the current operation completes, regardless of the current phase of the event loop.

 whereas setImmediate is part of event loop and is designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completes
